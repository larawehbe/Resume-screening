"""
Golden eval cases for the Resume-to-JD pipeline.

Each case pairs a JD + a resume with expected score ranges. We use ranges
instead of exact scores because LLM output varies a few points from call
to call — a strong-match candidate should reliably land in 80-100, but
"exactly 87" isn't a test we can pass reliably.

To add a new case, append another EvalCase to the ALL_CASES list at the
bottom.
