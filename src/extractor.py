"""
First LLM call: turn raw resume text into a validated CandidateProfile.

This module establishes the tool-use + Pydantic pattern that scorer.py and
critique.py both follow. Read this file first and the other two will make
sense quickly — they are variations on the same three beats:

    1. Build a tool whose `input_schema` is a Pydantic model's JSON schema.
       Claude treats that schema as the contract for the tool's arguments.
    2. Force Claude to call exactly that tool via `tool_choice`. This turns
       a free-form chat call into a structured-output call: the response is
       guaranteed to contain a tool_use block with JSON that fits the schema.
    3. Pull the tool_use block out of `response.content` and hand its
       `input` dict to `Model.model_validate(...)`. Pydantic raises if the
       LLM returned anything malformed, so the rest of the pipeline can
       trust the object it gets back.

Prompts live in src/prompts.py, never inlined here.
